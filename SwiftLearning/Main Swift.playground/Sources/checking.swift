// file private allows access to code created within the same entity and not limited to lexicol scope or extensions as is the case with private.
// here i can access the privaet due to extensions. line 48

// easily added to the checking without adding major damage to the main code and can easily be removed at no hustle or worry. i think i get it now.
// clean code.
